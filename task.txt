Our projects require a strong working skillset with Chef. I thought it would be fun to write some Chef code to see where you are in this craft.
Please complete the following tasks against this image (link):

- Install latest Microsoft patches

- install IIS

- open firewall port tcp/80

- create a site 'icons' on port 80

- host this content:
https://github.com/colebemis/feather.git

Please use one recipe for the patches and another recipe for the installation of IIS. Please store the code in a github repo and send me (Jeff Whitworth, jwhitworth@trace3.com ) a link. Grant me access to read that repo and we can work on it together.
